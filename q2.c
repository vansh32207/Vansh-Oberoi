/*
Q2: Write a program to input two numbers and display their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
Note: Division by zero should be handled carefully.

Sample Test Cases:
Input 1: 10 2
Output 1: Sum=12, Diff=8, Product=20, Quotient=5

Input 2: 7 3
Output 2: Sum=10, Diff=4, Product=21, Quotient=2
